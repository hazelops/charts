## HazelOps Library for Kubernetes

Applications, provided by [HazelOps](https://hazelops.com), ready to launch on Kubernetes using [Kubernetes Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm).

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.24+
- Helm 3.8.0+

## Setup a Kubernetes Cluster

To install Kubernetes Cluster, please refer to the Kubernetes [getting started guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/).

## Install Helm

Helm is a tool for managing Kubernetes charts. Charts are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources.

To install Helm, refer to the [Helm install guide](https://github.com/helm/helm#install) and ensure that the `helm` binary is in the `PATH` of your shell.

## Using Helm

Once you have installed the Helm client, you can deploy a Bitnami Helm Chart into a Kubernetes cluster.

Please refer to the [Quick Start guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/) if you wish to get running in just a few commands, otherwise the [Using Helm Guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/) provides detailed instructions on how to use the Helm client to manage packages on your Kubernetes cluster.

## Useful Helm Client Commands:


### Add repo

```console
helm repo add hazelops https://hazelops.github.io/charts/
helm repo update
```

### Install a chart:

```console
helm install [RELEASE_NAME] hazelops/[CHART]
```

### Upgrade application: 

```console
helm upgrade [RELEASE_NAME] [CHART] --install
```
